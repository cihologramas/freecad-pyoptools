Welcome to FreeCAD-pyOpTools's Documentation!
=============================================

Overview
--------
FreeCAD-pyOpTools integrates the powerful optical raytracing capabilities of 
the pyOpTools library into FreeCAD. This workbench is designed for anyone 
involved in the design and simulation of optical systems, facilitating work
with lens layouts and optomechanical elements. Note that this workbench focuses
on simulation rather than rendering.

.. note::
   The development of the workbench and its documentation is ongoing. Users 
   should anticipate updates that may change functionality or compatibility.
